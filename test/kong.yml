# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is an example file to get you started with using
# declarative configuration in Kong.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Metadata fields start with an underscore (_)
# Fields that do not start with an underscore represent Kong entities and attributes

# _format_version is mandatory,
# it specifies the minimum version of Kong that supports the format

_format_version: "1.1"

# Each Kong entity (core entity or custom entity introduced by a plugin)
# can be listed in the top-level as an array of objects:

services:
- name: echo-service
  url: http://localhost:3005
#   # Entities can store tags as metadata
#   tags:
#   - example
#   # Entities that have a foreign-key relationship can be nested:
  routes:
  - name: example-route
    paths:
    - /
# - name: another-service
#   url: https://example.org

# routes:
# - name: another-route
#   # Relationships can also be specified between top-level entities,
#   # either by name or by id
#   service: example-service
#   hosts: ["hello.com"]

# consumers:
# - username: example-user
#   # Custom entities from plugin can also be specified
#   # If they specify a foreign-key relationshp, they can also be nested
#   keyauth_credentials:
#   - key: my-key
#   plugins:
#   - name: rate-limiting
#     _comment: "these are default rate-limits for user example-user"
#     config:
#       policy: local
#       second: 5
#       hour: 10000

# When an entity has multiple foreign-key relationships
# (e.g. a plugin matching on both consumer and service)
# it must be specified as a top-level entity, and not through
# nesting.

plugins:
- name: kong-opaque-jwt
#   consumer: example-user
#   service: another-service
